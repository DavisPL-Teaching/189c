Hypothesis

# Advantages

Some more about advantages:

"I've never introduced property tests [Hypothesis specs] without finding a bug in either the specification or implementation. I have repeatedly spent time figuring out where the bug was in my property testing library before realising that it was correct and the obviously correct code I was testing was actually wrong."

# Disadvantages

Most important limitation:

- Testing might not find the bug!

Edsger Dijkstra:

    "Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence."

This is not a problem with the spec itself, but with using random testing
as a method of validating the spec.

Limitations related to writing specs -- these are not specific to Hypothesis (!)

- Specification could be wrong

- Specification could be incomplete

Other limitations of Hypothesis specifically?

- Customization

- Testing can be redundant.

Quick recap:
- we talked about different types of specifications
    (functional correctness, safety, liveness)
- we talked about preconditions and postconditions
- we talked about assert/assume

    + A pre/post condition based spec is called
        functional correctness

    + assume/assert based spec is everything that Hypothesis can express
        (slightly more general)

- we talked about limitations of Hypothesis: it can't
    prove there are no bugs.
    That is what the remaining tools in this class
    will be about.
