Lecture 1, Part 4:
Assume and Assert

===== Assume and assert =====

Going back to our divide by zero example.

What if we want to write it to include positive and negative integers,
not only positive integers?

    return x / y

"""
These two little functions, assume and assert, turn out to be
fundamentally important to testing & verification.

- Assert: This property should hold, if it doesn't, that's an
    error. I want to report a test failure.
- Assume: This property should hold, if it doesn't, I want to
    ignore this test.

Assert and assume interact in interesting ways...

Poll:

Which of the following has no effect? (Select all that apply)
- assert True
- assert False
- assume True
- assume False
- assert P if it occurs immediately following assume P
- assume P if it occurs immediately following assert P

Some of you may have picked up on the facts that:

- preconditions are just assume() statements
- postconditions are just assert() statements.

precond P, program f, postcondition Q
    == equivalent to ==
    assume(P(x))
    y = f(x)
    assert(Q(y))

We have to be careful with assume!
It's very dangerous.

# Another example
# Is this program for sorting a list correct? :)

def sort_list(l):
    l = l.copy()
    return l

# The spec:
@given(st.lists(st.integers()))
def test_sort_list(l):
    assume(l == sorted(l))
    assert sort_list(l) == sorted(l)

Another way of thinking about this is, whose responsibility is
it to ensure the list is sorted?
- If I use assume, I'm saying it's the caller's responsibility.
- If I use assert, in a specification to say that some property
  is true, then I'm saying it's the function's responsibility
  to guarantee that property.
"""

"""
Now that we know about assume and assert,
A more complete definition of specifications in Hypothesis:

Hypothesis can express exactly those specifications that are
expressible using assume() and assert().

- On all input executions such that all assume() statements
  hold up to a given point,
  all assert() statements hold after that point.
