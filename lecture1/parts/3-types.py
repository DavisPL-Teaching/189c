===== Thursday, April 10 =====

From last time, a specification denotes a set of programs:

    ⟦ Spec ⟧ ∈ 2^Prog

    ^ read: denotation of a spec is a subset of all programs.

    Spec is written in some grammar
    Prog is the set of all programs written in some grammar

S1 is stronger than S2 if:

    ⟦ S1 ⟧ ⊆ ⟦ S2 ⟧

Observation:

-  "Stronger than" is a mathematical partial order on specifications.
    (Actually a preorder)
    (This means... it's transitive and reflexive)

    1. For all S1, S2, S3, if ⟦ S1 ⟧ ⊆ ⟦ S2 ⟧ and ⟦ S2 ⟧ ⊆ ⟦ S3 ⟧ then ⟦ S1 ⟧ ⊆ ⟦ S3 ⟧.

    2. For all S, ⟦ S ⟧ ⊆ ⟦ S ⟧

Fun exercise (thanks to a student after class last time!)

- Show that the partial order is countable, has infinite width, and has infinite height.

Another exercise:

- Define a similar partial order on programs: P1 *refines* P2 if all specs true of P1 are true of P2.

  Is this partial order interesting or is it trivial?

=== Types of Specifications ===

Our definition of "specification" is very broad:

    ⟦ Spec ⟧ ∈ 2^Prog

this is very useful! But it is also not very specific.

In practice, we need our specification to be understandable to the tool we are using...
    i.e.: written in a more specific grammar

- Hypothesis only understands specs using @given annotations on pytests (+ assert and assume)

- Verification tools like Z3 and Dafny only understand specs written in formal logic
  (typically, first-order logic)

Here are some examples (some previous and some new ones) on integer_sqrt:

1. If the input is an integer, then the output is an integer.

    Let's think of our program integer_sqrt, as just a function f

    Forall x, if x ∈ Int then f(x) ∈ Int.

2. False (false of all programs)

    False

3. The input arguments are not modified by the program.

    # check x before and after the run
    Forall x0, if x = x0 then after f(x) is called (?) x = x0.

    What if f modifies x, does something, and then changes it back?
    A: We have no way of really getting a hold on this purely
    using statements about what's true before and after f runs.

4. If the input is greater than or equal to 100, then the output is greater than or equal to 10.

    Forall x, if x ≥ 100 then f(x) ≥ 10

5. The program does not read any files from the filesystem

    ???
    Check the journal log of the computer?
    We would need some way to log all of the function calls
    (in this case sytem calls) that are made by f when it executes.
    This would be somewhat difficult to do in Hypothesis alone.

6. The program executes in constant time
7. The program always terminates

You could try to write these in Hypothesis...
... but you would soon run into trouble.

Types of specs above?
Try translating them to logical statements about a program f.

Some questions:

- Are all of these specifications expressible as Hypothesis tests?

    No - some are, some aren't

- Are all of these specifications easily checkable?

    No - some are, some aren't

Other examples?
    (see cut/other-specs.md)

=== Classes of specifications ===

The discussion about which are testable using Hypothesis might leave
you wondering what properties exactly *can* be tested using Hypothesis
(or easily tested in general)?

This raises an important distinction:

    For some of the specs above, we were able to write the spec
    just thinking of the program as a mathematical function f
    (like f(x) = x^2, f(x) = e^x, etc.)
    only defined by its input-output behavior.

- A **functional correctness** property is a spec which only depends
  on the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) such that f(x) = y.

But even "True" and "False" are examples of this which aren't very useful.
Also "if the input is an integer, then the output is an integer"
isn't very useful.

- A **full functional correctness** spec is one which exactly specifies
    what f should do on every input.

    That means: for all x, f(x) is exactly the value y
    Or more formally our spec should satisfy a functional property like

    Example: if we say "whenever x is an integer, f(x) is an integer", this doesn't define which integer it is!
    but in our example:

        "for all integers x, y = f(x) is an integer such that x * x <= y < (x + 1) * (x + 1)"

    can actually show that there is only one such y.
    So this is a full functional correctness spec.

    For any f1, f2 satisfying the spec S, if f1(x) = y1 and f2(x) = y2
    then y1 == y2.

Two other special cases of specifications that turn out to be particularly useful
(these are not functional correctness):

These have to do with the behavior of the program when run
(properties of the program trace):

- A **safety property** states that "for all x, when f(x) is run,
  some bad event X does not happen."

    "the program doesn't read any files"
    "the program doesn't modify its input x"

- A **liveness property** states that "for all x, when f(x) is run,
  some good event X does happen."

    "f(x) does terminate"

(Neither of these can be specified using functional correctness.)

Are the above all possible specifications?
No! We can imagine much more interesting cases...
    (More examples, again, in cut/other-specs.md)

Review:

Can we test safety properties in Hypothesis?

Can we test liveness properties in Hypothesis?

What are all possible specifications expressible in Hypothesis?
(pin in this question - more on this soon)

"""
=== Functional correctness ===

Functional correctness is the focus of many program verification efforts in practice.
It's not perfect, but it is often a good starting point!
And we have good tools for reasoning about it (compared to some of the others
which require deep and difficult encodings, more on this later.)

- Often other properties can be encoded as functional correctness
  by maintaining some additional "state".

We typically express functional correctness using...

=== Preconditions and postconditions ===

    (A.k.a. Hoare triples)

A pre/postcondition spec has the following form:

    precondition: P: Input -> Bool
    postcondition: Q: Output -> Bool

    - if P is true before executing the program, and we execute f,
      Q is true after.

    - Equivalently: if P(x) is true and y = f(x) then Q(y) is true.

All functional correctness specs can be written using preconditions
and postconditions!

Q: Why do we need preconditions?

    can't we do:
    if y = f(x) then (P(x) -> Q(y)) is true?

    Yes that encoding works but doesn't allow us to talk about the
    state of the program before executing it.

Exercise (skip for time):
Rewrite the examples 1-7 using preconditions/postconditions

Even if you have not heard of the word "precondition",
you are probably intuitively familiar with the concept of preconditions
if you have some experience programing and working with libraries...

Examples:
- list pop: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

    "It raises an IndexError if the list is empty or the index is outside the list range."

    This is another way of saying that the precondition of
    list.pop() is that the list should be nonempty.

- file open: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open

    Has a number of preconditions:
    - The file should be able to be opened (OSError otherwise)

    - "If closefd is False and a file descriptor rather than a filename was given, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed. If a filename is given closefd must be True (the default); otherwise, an error will be raised."

Point:
You can often read off preconditions from the documentation!

Point:
Often a precondition that's useful is whatever is needed to not
have the program crash.
In practice, exceptions are often used to enforce preconditions --
if we don't know what to do on a particular input, we crash the program

Note that we can model exceptions in our specification in two
ways:
- If the exception is expected behavior, we can test that
  when the function is run on the bad input, the exception is raised.
  This does NOT involve excluding the input via the precondition,
  instead we write an assertion to expect the correct behavior.

- If the exception is not expected behavior, or if we don't
  want to consider inputs for which the exception is raised
  as valid, we can exclude them via a precondition.

Another example:

def divides_2(x, y):
    return x / y

ERROR = .000001

@given(
    st.integers(min_value = -100, max_value = 100),
    st.integers(min_value = -100, max_value = 100),
)
def test_divides_2(x, y):
    # could do e.g.:
    # assume -100 <= y <= 100
    assume(y != 0)
    result = divides_2(x, y)
    assert (result * y - x < ERROR)

"""
With the precondition included, the spec says:
On all inputs x, y such that
        -100 <= x <= 100 and
        -100 <= y <= 100 and
        y is not zero,
    divides_2(x, y) * y is approximately x.

More generally, the spec has the following form:

    "On all inputs x such that P(x) holds, Q(f(x)) holds."

Are pre and postconditions sufficient?

- Can we now express all properties we are interested in?

- Can Hypothesis express anything that pre/postconditions can't?

A: Yes
    - Runtime? we could write a Hypothesis test that times the program
      (using time.time or something)
    - What about running the program multiple times?
        e.g.: test that the program is deterministic
            y1 = f(x)
            y2 = f(x)
            assert y1 == y2
    - What about asserting something inside the program?
        Put assertions inside your program
        and assertions before/after running different programs
        so, you don't only have to assert things at the end.

More general way of thinking about the
kind of specifications that Hypothesis can support:
