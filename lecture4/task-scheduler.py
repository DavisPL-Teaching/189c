Day 11

(to follow along: 189C/lecture4/task-scheduler.py)

Announcements

- HW2 due in one week

- HW1 grading: comments will show up in your GitHub pull request;
    please hold off on regrade requests until further instructions
    are posted on Piazza.

Recap:

- We used Z3 to build a Sudoku solver

- Z3 is likely faster and easier than what you could write by hand:

    + about 30 lines of code
    + runs in a tenth of a second

Plan for today:

- Start with the poll

- Use Z3 to build a task scheduler

- This time, we will also focus more on good style (code organization).

=== Task scheduler ===

Given a list of tasks, including the time it takes to complete each task, the time until the deadline, and during what hour(s) it can be completed, is it possible to schedule the tasks in a way that we can complete all of them before the deadline?
If so, what's an example schedule?

=== Example input ===

Schedule start time: 8am (8)
Task: 1, 3 hours, 12 hours, 8am to 8pm
Task: 2, 2 hours, 10 hours, 8am to 8pm
Task: 3, 1 hour, 5 hours, 8am to 8pm

=== Example output ===

8am-9am: Task 3
9am-11am: Task 2
11am-2pm: Task 1

=== Design considerations ===

Let's assume that tasks are always scheduled in 1-hour blocks.
(1 hour is the smallest time unit here)

Will it always be possible?
No.

Is it possible there is space where we are doing nothing?
Yes

Do we always do one task in one contiguous block?
(For simplicity, let's say no for now.
but we could add it if we wanted to in a future update to our app.)
You have to do each task in one sitting.

What are we prioritizing?
What are we optimizing for here?
(For simplicity, let's set aside this q for now,
but we could add it if we wanted to in a future update to our app.)

=== 3 Steps ===

Let's first consider our three steps:

Remember: Think about the output, not the input.

1. What are the variables?
2. What are the constraints?
3. What are the properties we want to check?

1. What are the variables?

The tasks and the information about them
- how long they take, when you can do them, when they are due
(^ this one is input, not output)

Make a variable for each one hour chunk
^ 2nded

Make a variable for the first task that gets completed,
the second one, and so on.

a boolean?

Mapping of tasks to time that they are completed at?

For each task, what time should we start that task?
^
Let's go with the last one

Let's make a Python class for our scheduler.

API we have in mind:

    scheduler = Scheduler(start_time)
    scheduler.add_task(...)
    scheduler.add_task(...)
    scheduler.get_solution() # print solution

=== Day 12 ===

Announcements:

- HW1 has been graded

- HW2 due this Friday

- HW3 early release -- due next Friday

Plan:

- Go over a few of the HW1 problems

- A bit on differences between Hypothesis and Z3
  (we will also discuss this more in the future)

- Continue with our task scheduler

Questions?

=== Hypothesis vs Z3 ===

Some of you have already figured out: Hypothesis and Z3 are very different.
They work differently and they are used differently.

Hypothesis methodology:
- Write a program
- I want to make sure it's correct -- write a test with
  a spec for that program
- Then run hypothesis to find out if the program passes the spec

Z3 methodology:
- Think about what problem I'm using Z3 to solve, and what
  is the *output* to the problem
- What Z3 variables I can use to describe the output and
  constraints on the output (3 steps that we've been using)
- Then encode the problem and pass it to Z3 to solve

Poll:
Which of the following are key differences between Hypothesis and Z3?

=== Day 13 ===

Announcements:

- HW2 due Friday
    + Extra office hour on Friday at noon

- HW3 due next Friday

Plan:

- Finish up the task scheduler

- Move on to Lecture 5: Advanced Z3
