    assert P;
    assert Q;

    ^^^ suppose P ==> Q is logically true, but P passes and Q fails, why might
        this be?

  Sometimes, Dafny assertions do not pass.

    // So?
    // Does Dafny even know the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]?
    // Evaluating the array a1 is doing computation!
    // What's happening - 1 is below the length of an array that Dafny
    // is willing to evaluate; 5 is above that amount.

    === Tips when you get stuck ===

    Some techniques for when you get stuck on a Dafny proof.

    1. Find out what Dafny knows.

    You can query with assertions!

        assert P

      If it passes - either Dafny knows P (or Dafny did not previously
          know P, but now does)

      If it fails - Dafny does not know P.

    2. Abstract the missing step or cases
       into a lemma with a precond and postcond.

    3. Convince yourself the thing you're trying to prove is true!
       Once you are convinced, *assume* away the lemma you need (or axiom it),
       and come back to it later,
       to make the proof go through.

    The above technique will allow you to decompose any proof into smaller
    parts, and tackle each part one at a time.

    If you've simplified the property at all - you've made progress!
    That's all we need in order to guarantee we eventually complete it.

=== End notes ===

What are the main advantages of Dafny?

1. Prove arbitrary code correct
2. Don't need to rewrite the code in verification language (executable/verifiable code in same framework)
3. Compile & integrate with other languages

What are the main limitations of Dafny?

1. High effort to write and verify real-world software
  (10x estimate)
2. Q is true, but not provable from P?

    could be: your code is actually correct, and you can't prove it!

(1) is true, but not fundamental.
(2) is actually possible and is more fundamental.

To understand the more fundamental limits of Dafny,
then, we need to go back to the logics on which Dafny is built,
and in particular to proofs in first-order logic (FOL) and Hoare logic.
We will spend some more time going forward on foundations.

    ===== Discussion on industry applications =====

    Course goals:
    - to understand how verification works
    - to apply verification to real-word projects

    The methodology of verification:

    1. We encode the problem we are considering
      (based on real software, in a real industry application)
      in preconditions, postconditions, and other domain-specific constraints
      in an appropriate verification framework.

    2. We use the tool to prove the property, thus proving the code 100% free from bugs.

    When is this methodology useful in practice?
    Not always! But often in cases where correctness, safey, or security is critical
    to system functioning.
    Investment examples:

    - Amazon: verifying low-level cryptographic libraries using tools
      like Dafny and CBMC, verifying domain-specific security constraints
      (e.g., your cloud data cannot be accessed by untrusted users)

    - Microsoft: many applications of Z3 and other techniques internally, verifying network code,
      device and kernel drivers, etc.

    - Hardware bugs & hardware verification:

        Pentium FDIV bug: affected Intel Pentium processors in 1994.
        recall of all defective Intel processors at the time
        $475 million in losses!

    - Signal messaging app: verification effort for core messaging protocol going back to 2017

    - Larger-scale realistic software projects coming from academia:
        CompCert: a verified optimizing C compiler
        CertiKOS: a verified operating system kernel
        Increasing interest from the systems community and more work every year on building
        bigger verified file systems, network controllers, etc.

    - More generally, at large industry scale, security bugs cost a LOT of money.
      Higher-ups will throw money at any technique which even has a chance of preventing large-scale
      security risks (willing to invest).

    - The argument is that despite a much greater effort, we also get a greater payoff.
      Verify your library ==> greater assurance against threats, more people want to use it,
      maintain the verification conditions on all future software updates

// FYI: same thing happens for seq<int> instead of array<int>.

method MinList3(a: seq<int>) returns (min: int)
    requires |a| >= 1
    ensures exists i :: (0 <= i < |a|) && a[i] == min
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |a| ==> min <= a[i]
{
    min := a[0];
    var i := 1;
    while i < |a|
        invariant 0 < i <= |a|
        // invariant: min <= any value in the array before index i
        invariant forall j :: 0 <= j < i ==> min <= a[j]
        // invariant: min is an element of the array so far
        invariant exists j :: 0 <= j < i && min == a[j]
    {
        if a[i] < min {
            min := a[i];
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    return min;
}

method TestMinList3() {
    var a1 := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15];
    var result1 := MinList3(a1);

    // Needed for the proof to go through
    // (Try commenting this out)
    assert a1[0] == 1;

    assert result1 == 1;

/*
    What are the main advantages and limitations of Dafny?

    - Invariants are very difficult to figure out (even for a human!) and very
        effort intensive

    - It inherits some of the same limitations of Z3
        + If Z3 returns unknown or times out, Dafny also doesn't know what to do
        + This is exactly what makes verification sometimes so difficult: we need
            to add more information to help Dafny get through the assertion and give
            it enough information to pass to Z3 so that Z3 knows the assertion is true.
        + This is actually both a benefit and a drawback, as unlike
            with Z3 where it can be unclear what additional information
            to add to get the proof to work (we saw this somewhat in HW3),
            with Dafny we at least know that we can add some additional
            information to eventually get the proof to go through.

    Summary:
        - A lot more expressive and general; but
        - A lot more effort intensive to get the proofs to go through.

    Finishing with a quote from the Dafny tutorial:
    https://dafny.org/latest/OnlineTutorial/guide

    Even if you do not use Dafny regularly, the idea of writing down exactly what it is that the code does is a precise way, and using this to prove code correct is a useful skill. Invariants, pre- and post conditions, and annotations are useful in debugging code, and also as documentation for future developers. When modifying or adding to a codebase, they confirm that the guarantees of existing code are not broken. They also ensure that APIs are used correctly, by formalizing behavior and requirements and enforcing correct usage. Reasoning from invariants, considering pre- and postconditions, and writing assertions to check assumptions are all general computer science skills that will benefit you no matter what language you work in.
