N Queens Problem

The 8 queens problem is a classic chess puzzle.
A chess board is an 8x8 grid. The goal is to place 8 queens on the board such that no two queens can "attack" each other using the rules of chess.

- "Attack" means that two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.


   | x |   |   | y |
   |   | z |   |   |

x can attack y and vice versa
x can attack z and vice veras
but y and z cannot attack each other

=== Input ===

n: the size of the n x n board
    (default: n = 8)

=== Output ===

Output a solution for the n queens in the form of
an n x n grid where each cell is either " " or "Q".

How to approach solving a problem in Z3?

1. Pick your variables

2. Encode the constraints of your problem

3. Call solve() or prove() to automatically determine an answer.

Starting with step 1:
what should our variables be?

- 2D Boolean array of the chessboard: True = queen is present, False = queen is not present?

- Encode how many queens there are in one row?

- Keep an array of positions of the queens on the board? (x, y) coordinates

2. Encode constraints

What constraints do we need to encode?

- column of queen i should be between 0 and (n-1)
- queen i and queen j are not in the same row
- queen i and queen j are not in the same column (given)
- queen i and queen j are not in off diagonals
